# 🔐 CipherStrength
- A modular password security engine

A secure authentication-based login system developed as part of a cybersecurity hackathon project.  
This project demonstrates how to protect login systems from common cyber attacks and ensure safe user authentication using proper validation and security mechanisms.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Many web applications suffer from insecure login systems which can lead to:
- Unauthorized access
- Brute-force attacks
- SQL Injection
- Credential theft
- Session hijacking

There is a need for a secure login mechanism that validates users properly and prevents common cyber threats.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

We developed a secure login system that:
- Validates user credentials safely
- Restricts unauthorized access
- Prevents malicious input
- Uses session-based authentication
- Demonstrates secure coding practices

The system ensures that only authenticated users can access protected areas.
